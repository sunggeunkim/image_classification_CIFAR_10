# Image classification CIFAR-10

## This is part of Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Project

This project is an attempt to classify images from CIFAR-10 dataset.
The data is pre-processed using techniques such as normalization and one-hot encoding.
Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to train and test the model.
For CNN, max-pooling and drop-out technique is used.

## Install

To run the project, following packages need to be installed. 
* python 3.5
* jupyter
* tqdm
* tensorflow
* sklearn
* numpy
 
## Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory image_classification_CIFAR_10/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook dlnd_image_classification.ipynb```

or

```jupyter notebook dlnd_image_classification.ipynb```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

The [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects
